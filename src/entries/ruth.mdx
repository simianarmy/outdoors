### Party: Cassi, Grace, Shannon, a few other non-SACers

Ruth is a popular climb for starting the season.

Super early start for our car-2-car summit day.  Fortunately I slept at the cabin
so not as crazed as the Bellingham folks.  We hit the trail while still
dark but didn't need headlamps for long.  Forecast was clear skies and heat.

We switched to mtn boots shortly before Hannegan pass.  Snowpack was soft enough
that no crampons were needed.  We made good time up towards Ruth Arm and stopped
a few times to enjoy the views of Shuksan.

Roped up at the edge of the glacier forming 2 teams.  No visible crevasses.  Reached
summit and weather was so mild we spent a good hour just relaxing and taking many 
pix.  Summit beers may have been cracked.

Headed back and did a few fun glissades after the glacier.  Split up with Shannon
at the pass - she was going to spend the night camping in the area.  Hike back
was hot - felt sorry for the SAC BMC class summitting on Baker the same day!

Once back at the car we wasted no time dipping body parts in the river.  Short
ride for me back to the cabin.
