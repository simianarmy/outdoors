  A damn fine cross-country hike.  Circumnavigates summits of North Guard,
  Mount Brewer, South Guard, Thunder Mountain, and Mount Jordan while crossing
  the Great Western Divide and the Kings-Kern Divide.

  The cross country is over loose talus and brush or glaciated granite slabs.
  4 passes require class 2 scrambling.  Offers a unique and definitely not well-travelled path;
  some of the passes are not even on the map.  A+ for solitude.  Once back on
  the PCT/JMT trail, traffic increased dramatically - not surprising for
  Labor day weekend.

  Next time I will bring a fishing rod - all the lakes were jumping with
  fishies!

  Hiked through the remnants of a still-smoldering fire above the Sphinx
  Trail junction.  Spoke with a firefighter and hiked past one for their
  staging camps.

  Saw quite a few bears.  One climbing down from a tree in the parking lot, one
  cub/yearling in the bushes next to the trail, and a couple across a river.
  Just missed a rattlesnake or two.
