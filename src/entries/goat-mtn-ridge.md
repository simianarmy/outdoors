Quick overnighter south of Raininer in the Gifford Pinchot National Forest.  Scenic ridge
hiking with plenty of views of all the volcanic peaks - Adams, St Helens,
Rainier, & even Hood.  Overnight at idyllic Deadman's Lake.

Trail starts with pleasant hike underneath Leona Falls.  After a river ford,
the trails ascends for a long time to Tumwater Mountain.  From there it's
a leisurely ridge trail hike with sweeping eastern views to Deadman's Lake.

In the morning, took a side trip up to a ridge over Green River Valley with
epic views of the Mt Margaret Wilderness' northern peaks.  Great views of
Rainier to the North on the way up, and a clear view of St Helens, Mt Adams, & Mt Hood from the ridge.
