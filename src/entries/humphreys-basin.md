Loop climbs Pine Creek trail over Pine Creek Pass to French lakes area, traverses Humphreys basin (XC), connects with Piute Canyon trail down to Hutchinson Meadow, up French Canyon trail & XC up to Royce Lakes and back, over Pine Creek pass to Granite Park then back to trailhead.

Revisting the Pine Creek trail 2 years later this time to explore the
Humphreys Basin and Royce Lakes.  1st night at Elba lake was incredibly windy
with some snowfall.  Some snow travel with microspikes required to get over
Roget Lake pass into Humphreys Basin.  Unable to camp there due to lack of
trees for hammock.  Took a rest day after reaching Humphreys Meadow to relax by
Piute Creek.  Hiked up French Canyon trail and veered left & up to explore Royce
Lakes region.  Too much snow prevented me from connecting to Granite Park from
the lakes.  Backtracked and camped near Pine Creek pass.  On last day,
revisited Granite Park but w/out good trees tried camping at lower elevation.
Ran into too many mosquitoes at tentative campsite so finished the trip by
hiking out 1 day early.

Highlights: Humphreys Basin, views from Piute Canyon trail, Piute creek at
Huchinson Meadow, rugged beauty of Royce lakes, Granite Park with all its snow.

### Fun facts

At Royce Lakes, had to traverse semi-steep snowbank for about 100 feet.
Slip would have landed me into the frozen lake, so spent a lot of energy
kicking boots into the snow.  Had to repeat on the way back.
Decided not to try to cross over the small pass from Royce lakes to descend to
Granite Park due to unknown snow conditions on N. side.  Turned out being a
smart decision b/c when I surveyed the descent from the Granite Park side saw
that the way down was all steep snowpack.
