Hike of the coastal beaches in the Olympic peninsula from Rialto Beach to Sand
Point.

Continuing on my Epic Thanksgiving holiday trek tradition, I returned to the
Olympic peninsula to make a hike that I had wanted to do for a few years.  Hike
is from Rialto Beach in La Push north to Sand Point at the northern edge of the
park.

The hike requires shuttling about 60 miles.  I was unable to secure a van due
to the holiday, so decided to shuttle by bike.  Probably not the best
decision, considering the weight of my pack and the fact that there is
a serious hill to cross between the 2 beaches.  It took all day for me to ride
and the weather was not pretty.

### Fun facts

I biked with a full pack from Ozette Ranger Station to La Push. It was tough.
This is from the 2nd day from Forks to Rialto Beach. I stayed at a motel after
the 50 miles of riding, most of it in hard driving rain!  It took a long time
for my body to deprune.  Motel bed felt *really* good.

Timing the tides sucked. High tide near 11AM & sunset at 4:30 made things difficult.

Eroded, muddy, and wet cliff with rope ladders added some climbing excitement.

I misread a map and neglected to round a point before camping on the last
night.  This caused me to miss a low tide and the next day, instead of waiting
4 hours for the next one, I decided to x-country up and around.  Climbing
up a rocky streambed then on vines and shrubs 100 feet above took about 1 hour.  Bushwhacking through
dense, wet shrubbery and roots took a good 2 more hours.  Needless to say
I didn't save any time, but I guess it was fun in hindsight.

I had to hide my bike at Rialto since I didn't have a lock.  I had to stash it
deep in the woods near the trailhead and under deep shrubs.  I didn't plan on
returning to it before dark, so of course by the time I drove back to pick it
up it was pitch black with 50mph winds.  Equipped with raingear and headlamp,
I attempted to find the bike up the hillside which was thick with brambles and
vines.  I lucked out and caught the reflection of metal after about 40 minutes
of bushwhacking.
