Fun jaunt w/ Justin along part of the Trans Catalina Trail.

2 days across the unique island biome of Catalina Isl.  Dry and desert-like hills with scattered Bison roaming.

Late start on Thursday due to ferry crossing time and logistics.  Steep climb to the trail crest then rolling hills until nightfall to the busy camp at Black Jack mtn.

Bison visited our campsite the next morning for some good photo ops.  Passed by the "airport in the sky" for some snacks and water.  Down to the W. side at Little Harbor for a quick break then back to some steep climbs along the W. crest to Two Harbors by evening.  Next day got brunch in town before catching the ferry to San Pedro.

Unable to complete the trail that continues to the Northern peninsula due to campgrounds being full.
