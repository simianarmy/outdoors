Quick jaunt in the North Cascades near Mt Baker.

From the Twin Lakes road reached the trailhead around noon.  I had planned on camping
around the Elbow Lake area but a misread Google Maps let me to a closed road, missing
my appointment with the PNTA work party :(

Decided to drive north towards the Mt Baker ski area and check out the trails around
there.  Yellow Aster Butte seemed like a good short hike with high payoff.
Began gaining elevation quickly on this short hike.  Soon enough I had alpine flowers
and great views of Mt Baker and Mt Shuksan.  Reached the turnoff to the campgrounds
and continued up to the butte to take in the views.

Back to the trail I took the split that leads to the campgrounds in the basin below.
There were many tarns and a handful of tents scattered around the large area.
It didn't look like there too many good trees for hammocking in the area so I planned
on taking the Tommihoi trail up to a good viewpoint, then coming back down to look 
for camping in the treeline.  Climbed the steep trail for a wile until I got to the
point where it drops sharply to a saddle.  Decided to turn around there and took
in more great mountain views.  Reached the campgrounds around 6 & decided to take a 
closer look at some tree stands for possible hammock opportunities as the views were
nice.  I found some decent trees for hanging close to a family with tents, but not
so close that it would be rude.  Relaxed for a while until dinner tme.

Enjoyed dinner & a beer with nice sunset over Shuksan.  Had forgotten to bring 
insulation for the hammock & it did get a little chilly at night but was able to
fashion padding with sitpad and my pack to keep warm.

Up early to make an appointment in Sedro & quick hike down on a nice cool morning.

Next time - I'll bag Tommyhoi.
