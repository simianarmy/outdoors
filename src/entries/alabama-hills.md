First time climbing at top climbing destination: Red Rock Canyon, Nevada.

Drove up with Andre Sat morning and made it to the crag by noon.  Parking lot
was full with tourists but walked up to route a few feet from car.  Andre
practiced trad climbing on a short 5.6 crack and I followed on top-rope,
practicing cleaning the cams and draws.  Toes still sore from last weekend's
climbing on too-small shoes,  but pain would subside by 2nd day and gone on
3rd.  New shoes may be too big for me than the last, but at least my toes won't
frickin fall off.  After a couple on the crack moved to some harder routes
nearby then made for the city for dinner and supplies.  Set up camp at nearby
campground walk-up sites and hit the sack early.

2nd day started at Callico Hills area on the iconic red rock with some crowded
but enjoyable 5.8 routes.  Moved on to a 5.6 arrete climb then back to the
previous day's crack.  After full day, enjoyed some sushi and drove down the
Vegas strip to see the shiny lights.  Much more crowded and closed-in than
the 90's Vegas I remember.  Back to camp where we stayed up to watch the rare
Super Blood Wolf Moon event!  Once the moon had eclipsed and turned a rusty red
hue, wind really picked up so battened down the hatches and hit the sack.
Unfortunately since my Hilleberg was still out of commission, only had
a hammock and ultralight z-packs tent.  With no trees, was relying on the
z-packs which was no match for the 60 mph gusts assaulting the desert canyon
all night.  Spent most of the night restoring fallen trecking poles that act as
the only structure and basically being miserable.  By 5:30 I was already awake
for Andre's wake-up call.  Broke camp and decided at breakfast that it was
probably too windy to climb.  Nevertheless it seemed to have died down in town,
so we drove back to the reserve to check it out.  I thought it was too windy
but Andre seemed undeterred so we scrambled to a rock with a 5.7 or 5.8
multipitch.  Rock was just too cold for me and wind was blowing some light
hail pellets, so I convinced Andre we should bail after the 1st pitch.

After that we decided to check out a climbing spot outside of Barstow, CA on the
way home to see if it was less windy.  Drove into Apple Valley to a large clump of boulders (Fairview) and were met by
the friendly local routesetter who sold Andre a guidebook of his and led us to
some routes.  By the time we got there we had time for only a couple climbs each, but I got more chances to practice anchor & rope management
with a climber below for future multipitch climbs.
