First time climbing at Alabama Hills.  1 full day mostly lead-climbing on
various 5.6 - 5.8 routes. Drove up with Andre and met Patrick at Lone Pine.
Patrick was familiar with the Hills and took us to some great routes of which
there were hundreds.  Fairly busy with climbers & RV campers but there were
plenty of routes for everyone.
Climbed on iconic shark-fin rock with great views of Whitney in the distance.
Moved on to nice 2-pitch then to some harder bouldery short climbs with Andre
leading & us top-roping.  Camped at nearby paid campground mostly filled with
RV campers.

Broke tent pole from expensive Hilleberg tent! :(

On the 2nd lead climb of the 2nd day, was overconfident on a quite run-out section of
a 5.7 and unfortunately fell while clipping on the run-out.  Fell about 10 ft
and struck inner ankle of left foot
against the bolt.  Impact sheared the skin causing a wide bloody gash.
I felt the sharp pain but didn't realize I was bleeding until someone on the
ground asked if that was my blood - after which I noticed quite a bit of red on
the wall.  Was lowered and helped to the ground by the many bystander climbers
in the area.  Fortunately we were close to camps and cars so there were plenty
of people to help with first aid & bandages.  Got wound cleaned and dressed,
took some ibuprofen and helped to Andre's car.  Still bleeding pretty solidly
through bandages, we were expecting to have to drive to Bishop for nearest
hospital, but asked in town and fortunately there was a small hospital with ER
facility down the street.  Hobbled into the ER dripping blood on the ground and
spent a few hours getting stitched up (18 stitches!)  Was given crutches and
new dressings.  We ate lunch at a local diner then Andre drove us home.

It would take about 2 months before I could walk normally (mostly) again, but
fortunately no fractures or serious nerve / ligament damage.
