First multi-pitch experience at Echo Cliffs.

Half-day with Andre and Patrick enjoying a mix of top rope, lead on multipitch
route.  Got some good rappel and safety instructions on some challenging
routes.

### Fun facts

Andre's car keys fell out of his pocket into the brush while on the rock.  We
never found them though Patrick almost got bit by a snake while searching!
Patrick drove us back to LB where they helped me climb through my window to get
my car keys.  I drove us back to his car and almost ran out of gas!  Secured
some expensive Malibu gas before making the long drive back.  A full day of
driving!
