A nice jaunt along Deception Creek from Highway 2 near Stevens Pass.

Trail follows Deception creek up to the junction to Deception Pass.  Instead of
heading East, follows trail up to Tonga Ridge.  Camped in rainy weather at
ridge below Mt Sawyer.  In the morning, tried ascending Sawyer but clouds and
snow prevented me from making progress to the summit.  Lots of lush foliage,
river views.
