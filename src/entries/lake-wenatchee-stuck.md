Silly winter adventure on the way to Pete Lake.

Erik's car got stuck in the snow at the Pete Lake trailhead parking lot.  Nate,
Erik & I hiked on forest road back to main road, waited for car to hitch-hike
into town for rescue.  Erik returns with truck driving country folk (armed) who
hitches car back to road.  Picked up fire supplies and found a spot on the
river.  It was cooold.

Friends joined us the next day, we hiked around the area, then back to camp for
more fire.  Next morning, another car stuck, this time because hybrid oil
froze!  Towed car to town and hung out with garage folk til they warmed the oil
up enough.  Then everyone drove home.
