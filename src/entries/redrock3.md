Another great weekend trip to Red Rock with Andre

Left LB early to arrive in Vegas by 8am.  Beelined it back to Calico Basin to
v. crowded Red Riding Hood wall.  Earliest opening was on the newly bolted
sport route "Hound Dogs and Coyotes", a 5.9+ - 5.10a/b 2 pitch route to the top
of Big Bad Wolf.  Had a hard time on the crux, even on toprope, and ended up
using gear as aid for the move after struggling for 15 minutes on it.  Rest of
the climb was much easier and still super fun.  After that we lined up for BBW
with the plan that I would lead the 2nd or 3rd pitch.  Unfortunately I really
had to poop and that discomfort sappped my will to attempt a lead for the 1st
time after my injury.  Fortunately had brought toiletries in my backpack so
didn't have to rush back to the parking lot.  After those 2 long climbs, it was
nearing end of day so we decided to check out the camping spots nearby, which
were full as usual.  Drove West on the 160 to a campground about 40 mins. away
and set up camp before returning ot Vegas for some Italian dinner.  Had no
trouble sleeping after the hard day of climbing and big pasta meal.

Andre woke me at 5 for an early predawn start.  Broke camp & headed back to the
breakfast stop before returning to the same wall to attempt Physical Graffiti, a moderate trad climb with bolted anchor - 2 pitch 5.6 on some nice cracks.
Followed and cleaned the gear Andre left and really enjoyed the 2nd pitch which
involved actual crack climbing with feet, knees, and arms wedged into the crack
at various angles.  It was getting quite hot in the 80s so we had to hike back
to the car to drive into town for more water.  Returned to a new wall, The
Fringe, in Calico Basin but further than Red Riding Hood by about 20 mins.
After a long approach up large granite slabs, arrived at a beautiful red wall filled with climbers
enjoying the shaded routes.  Managed a 2 pitch 5.10a and finally got a chance
to rappel down before making our way back to the road home.

Enjoyed a rare drive back to the city without crazy traffic and arrived at
a reasonable hour.
