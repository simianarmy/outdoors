Nice high country loop in the Buckhorn Wilderness of Olympic National Park.

Classic Olympics hike through less crowded alpine terrain.  Plenty of towering
rhodedenrons, wildflowers, meadows, snow fields, alpine lakes, and high passes.
Great views of Mount Deception, Mount Constance, Mount Mystery, Raininer, & Mt
Olympus from Constance Pass.

Starting at the Dungeness River trailhead, trail follows the wide river before
the ascent to Boulder Shelter.  The trail splits from there to Constance Pass
and Marmot Pass.  Side trip to Home Lake just under Constance Pass for the
first night, then back up Marmot pass and down to Buckhorn lake for 2nd night.
Unfortunately missed supposedly some of the best views in the Olympics due to
thick clouds at Marmot pass.  I'll come back earlier in spring for the rhodies.

Caught a ride at the trailhead back back to the Dungeness TH.  There's a lake
somewhere up that trail that's good for fishing - forget the name.  Took the
long way back home over Tacoma Narrows bridge.

### Fun facts

A couple girls were camping at Home lake same night as me.  While packing up to
leave, they asked if I wanted to swim in the lake with them.  Like a god damn
pussy I said it was too cold for me and took off.  Dumb.

Would have spend the night of the 4th at Marmot pass, which has clear views of
the Seattle skyline.  It was already crowded with people with the same idea and
the barren pass didn't exactly have a lot of flat camping spots, so skipped it
for Buckhorn lake, which was way too crowded for my taste.
