John Muir Trail (Southbound)

18 days in late September from Yosemite Valley to Whitney Portal

9/13 - 9/30

Passes crossed in order:
Cathedral, Donohue, Island, Silver, Selden, Muir, Mather, Pinchot, Glen,
Forester, Trail Crest.

Highest Pass: Trail Crest (13670 ft)

Camped with hammock / tarp.  Most nights were chilly in the 30s - used foam pad
and ultralight airpad for insulation.  Usually slept in thermals and all
layers, including down jacket.
On last 2 nights where temps dropped below 20, used SOL blanket for extra
bottom insulation + hand warmers in socks and hot water nalgene.  Tent & winter
airpad would have been nice.
