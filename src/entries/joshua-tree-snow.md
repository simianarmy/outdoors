Cool day of climbing at Joshua Tree Hall of Horrors rocks with some strong winds to add some
challenge.

Warmed up on a 5.7 and 5.8 until noon then moved to another formation to find
a potential 5.7 with trad anchor.  Unable to find a good spot for such an
anchor, setup on a bolted anchor for what we thought was a 5.10-ish sport climb
route.  I got to put my body belay skills to the test to lower Andre down to
the anchor.  Andre did the 1st attempt and it looked pretty insane, but he
eventually made it up and set some draws to prevent some serious pendulums.
On my attempt, I quickly found myself at a point where I had to aid climb.  After good
instructions from Andre, was able to hoist myself up via feet in slings enough
to get over the crux.  Some challenging moves later made it to the top.  This
turned out being a 5.11b/c route (Cactus Flower)!  Pretty happy to have been able to finish it,
even with toprope and aid climbing!  Andre climbed it one more time to clean,
then did some trad setup but wind was getting too strong to do much more.
