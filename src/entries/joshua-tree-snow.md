Cool day of climbing at Joshua Tree with real snow in the desert!

Beautiful scenerey from a fresh coat of snow on Joshua Tree as we arrived in
the morning.  Spent the day on a single 5.7 route (Spaghetti & Chili?) where
Andre practiced placing trad gear while I toproped.  A single crux involving
undercling holds on a big flake made the route feel much harder than a 5.7, but
good practice and plenty of rest in between climbs.  Rappelling down from the
~75ft pitch added some reward to the ending.

Watched a nearby group toprope a 5.10d on a longer route - looked kind of fun
but probably v challenging.  Enjoyed views of the snow-covered Joshua trees and
boulders from the top of the crag.  Called it a day after 4 or so climbs.

While packing up, a passing climber informed us that someone had died on our
route a few years ago - hit his (unprotected) head on a shelf after a piece of gear
slipped...yikes!  Joshua Tree lead climbing is for pros only!  I'll stick to
toproping there.
