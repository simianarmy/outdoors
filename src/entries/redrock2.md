A great 2 1/4 day trip back to Red Rock with Andre and coworker from London
Matteo Rossi.

Another fun experience and a little more relaxed climbing with a 3rd to give me
time to rest between routes.  Andre really wanted to leave Friday night so that
we could start early, so we picked Matteo up in downtown then headed NE for
the long night drive to Vegas.  Campground was completely full, so we had to
find last minute hotel rooms.  Got a deal with the Tuscany Casino/Hotel on the
strip where we all shared a suite.  Up early next morning to eat then headed to
Calico I for the Panty Wall for a few 5.8s then to the 5.6 arrete followed by
the hard 5.10d, which was quite challenging, even on toprope.

Afterwards back to Panty Wall for Matteo's first outdoor lead climb, which he
aced.  After that to the 2-pitch that we had aborted due to cold last time.
Wrapped that up just as the sun was setting and desert night temps approaching.

They thought an AirBnb would be cheaper so we ended up at a real weird house
where the owner & roommate were still hanging out.  We got a tiny room with
room for 2 mattresses with kids blankets.  Negotiated for an air mattress in
the owner's "studio".  Regardless, hot shower then sleep so no complaints.

Next morning to Calico Basin outside of the actual park and made our way up to
popular Riding Hood Wall.  Arrived early enough to be the 2nd on Big Bad Wolf,
a 220 ft 3-pitch route with a 5.9 and 2 5.8s.  Andre lead tied to 2 thinner
ropes with Matteo and I belaying simultaneously.  Once at anchor, Andre then
toprope belayed us so that we could climb at the same time (one staying a few
bolts below the other.)  This sped up the whole process but lead to serious
rope management issues while at anchor.  Still quite enjoyable and somewhat
leisurely 1st real multipitch (I guess 2 pitches doesn't count!)  Learned more
about rope management than anything else.  At the top I was able to help out
climbers nearby who had lead without a belay device with which to bring up his
partner!  Since I had a spare grisgris they were able to use that without
resorting to Munter hitching.  We walked up the 4th pitch and followed the
friendly couple we had helped back down a trail to the base, where we
celebrated Matteo's birthday with some Whole Foods tirramissu!

Tried driving back into the park but they were full and closed the entrance so
we returned to the Basin (Cannial Crag) and toproped a 5.9 or so.  We decided to call it a day
after it started drizzling and we calculated return ETA around 11pm.  Stopped
for pizza dinner on Route 66 in Barstow then home for a good sleep.
