Summit of Glacier Peak on the classic Cool Glacier route.

I really wanted to summit Glacier this year so I put out feelers in the SAC chat
for July dates.  Lots of interest from the BMC '24 crew so had no problems filling
a rope team (Brian, Nate, Taylor, Meg).  We agreed on a 2 night outing, leaving early Saturday.

I left Seattle early morning to reach the N. fork Sauk th by 6:30am.  There were 5 
of us so we settled on an appropriate rope and split up remaining shared gear.
Started on a cool morning  with our heavy packs up the lush trail along easy terrain.

The trail did eventually get steep and we were all sweating once we reached the treeline.
We made good time though and took a break for lunch at White Pass.  In good spirits,
we continued on to Beaver pass, enjoying the wildflowers, marmots, and nearby peaks.
Hard going in the heat and steep terrain, but once we reached the pass we enjoyed
easier terrain into the more barren basin.  We had planned on hiking all the way to 
Glacier Gap, but by the time we reached the busier basin we were all done with our
heavy packs.  We found suitable camp and some of us took a refreshing dip in a tarn.

We had an early dinner and discussed logistics.  Another 2am start was agreed on.

I managed to get some sleep this time so by 2 I was refreshed and ready.  Some clouds
had rolled in and lowered visibility.  We had to do some occasional routefinding with
the low vis and mix of snow/rock/melt obscurring the common trail.  Taylor was not
feeling well and we stopped a few times along the way to let her assess.  We decided
to continue to Glacier Gap before she would make a call to continue or not.  We reached
the Gap a couple hours after leaving camp, but T's condition hadn't improved.  She
was nauseous and couldn't eat anything.  B. wasn't feeling well either so offered to 
return to camp with her with the remaining 3 of us continuing on.  We got our Garmins
connected and parted ways.

The rest of the way up was low vis but the way forward was clear enough.  Just
before sunrise we ascended above the misty clouds and had clear views of the false
summit and glaciers ahead.  We reached the snow and got the axes out.  We shouldve
put on crampons at that point, b/c there was a short section just off the rock
with a steep dropoff that had boot pack to follow, but the snow was so hard the 
axe could barely make a dent.  So a few minutes of terror until we got to a safer 
section, then we put on the crampons.

Continued up a ways then roped up as we approached the glaciated area.  Crossed
a few obvious crevasses covered by hard snow. until we rounded Disappointment peak
onto Cool glacier with the peak ahead.  Unroped once we reached dry strech and
hiked up last steep section of sand/dirt/rock to the final snow wall.  It was an
easy last stretch with crampons and we topped out to the summit.

Great 360 views so we signed our names in the logbook and took lots of pix before
stopping for a snack.

My Smartwater & filter flung out of my pack as I put it on and the bottle slid down
a ways before it stopped.  I was able to creep down to get it with crampons.

Long descent back to the rock with no major events.  We unroped and enjoyed the
downhill back down to camp, though it still took a while.  T & B back at camp were
resting and no one seemed too sick so that was a relief.  Had lunch, relaxed and
packed up.

Hiked back to White Pass to camp there to make our last days hike out easier.
Reached the pass just before sunset and enjoyed dinner with the skeeters.
I had no problem sleeping after the long day.

Up early the next morning to enjoy the facilities & last bfast.  Long dowhill hike
in light rain kept us cool & reached th sooner than planned.  We met up in Darrington
for nice lunch then parted ways.  I stopped at the BD outlet to get some SAC-discounted
goodies on the way home.

### Fun facts

- This was the last volcano to summit on my "Washington Volcanoes" list!  The first
one was Mt. St. Helens (Year??)
