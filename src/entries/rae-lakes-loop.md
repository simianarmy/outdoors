First hike in the South Sierras!  This was my first multi-night outing in the
Sierras since Yosemite in my youth!  One of the most popular hikes in the S.
Sierras was relatively uncrowded yet still sported sunny skies and warm,
mosquito-free nights.

Follows South Fork Kings River up Paradise Valley then
along Woods Creek past Castle Domes.  Continues upvalley along South Fork of
the creek past Dollar Lake to Rae Lakes.  Finally one last steep climb to Glen
Pass then mostly downhill to Junction Meadow and down lovely Bubbs Creek past The
Sphinx back to Roads End.

### Fun facts

Bit by bee on hand on first day - painful!  Same thing would happen one year
later on a hike from Roads End.

Whether from heat or actual sickness, first day was v tough - sweated it out in
hammock all night.

At Rae Lakes only one other group there but they still chose to park their tent
within spitting distance from me :-o

First close black bear encounter where the bears didn't run away!  Got some
good videos.
