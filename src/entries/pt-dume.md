Half day top roping at the beach.  My first outdoor top rope climb!  Me and
another beginner (Jesse) instructed by Andre.  Learned some slab climbing
techniques.  Andre gave rappel instructions which we practiced once.  Continued
top roping on the more difficult ocean-facing 5.10a.  Ran out of water
otherwise we probably would have stayed longer.  Had a nice lunch then returned
for one more round.

### Fun facts

There was a photo shoot on the beach right next to us with some young aspiring
bikini models.  Nice.
