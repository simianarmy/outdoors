North Fork Sauk River - PCT - Bald Eagle Trail - Pilot Ridge Trail Loop

3 day hike in the North Cascades. Got rained out the last 1/2 of the trip but
still had a good time. Would like to go back during wildflower season.  Missed
a few scrambles and side trips that are worth returning for.

Spent the night at White Pass off the PCT.  Second night at Blue Lakes.  Pilot
Ridge back to complete the loop.
