Scenic Mount Margaret Wilderness excursion (with Nate Vaughn.)

Secured permits to a night in the popular Mt Margaret Wilderness during the summer.  Plan was to complete a loop around the big lake north of Mt St Helens.  Unfortunately I misjudged the distance and it became more of an out-and-back trip.

Got started at a reasonable hour with some cloud cover to beat the summer heat.
From the St Helens visitor center, we made good time into the wilderness area
and climbed into the upper elevations.  Epic views and rugged scenery all the
way to a steep ridge leading to our designated campsite.  After a side-trip to
secure some water in a hidden spring, we set out to the traverse the ridge.
It quickly became clear that this would be a Class 2+ / 3 traverse and neither
of us were prepared to find out how far we could go along sheer 500ft falls on
both sides.  Backtracking, we had to make the same dangerous treck back then
had to share a campsite with some friendly anglers.  Fortunately there was
plenty of room for 2 groups, and we ended up with a great site with northern
views of Rainier.

Sunrise views of Rainier and St Helens.  Clear sunny day on the hike back - ran
low on water towards the end but made it back fairly early.
