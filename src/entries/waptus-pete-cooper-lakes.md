An early season loop through lower Alpine Lakes.

Starting at Salmon La Sac trailhead up along the roaring Waptus river to Waptus Lake for the first night.
Next day climbed up to Waptus Pass crossing many snowbanks and frozen streams.
A bit of GPS navigation needed to find my way along the snow-covered trails.

Down the pass to Pete Lake for the 2nd night.  Enjoyed prime spot along the
popular lake with no crowds to bother me.  Last day hiked along Cooper River
and past Cooper Lake to close the loop.
