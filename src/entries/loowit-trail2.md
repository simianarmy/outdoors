CCL Circumambulation of Mt St Helens.

Returned to hike this awesome trail again, this time with a better knowlowedge of 
distances and difficulties.

Only had 2 days and had wanted to start on the NW or NE approaches, but trail closures 
during the work week limited my options to the Climber's Bivouac.

Drove there in the evening on Friday & slept in the car in the parking lot.
Plenty of climbers were there in the morning for summit attempts - our trails diverged
as I took a right onto the Loowit.  Passed June lake without stopping for water and 
enjoyed nice views of Mt Hood and Mt Adams as I made my way up the E. face of Helens.

Quite a few trail runners passed me - I wondered if they were doing a full loop - would 
be a Marathon+ if so!  Passed a few groups of hikers but mostly hiked alone & got good
water at the Plains of Abraham campground.  Continued up Windy Pass and down to the 
Pumice plains to the N.  Reached a good lunch spot with views of Rainier and Spirit lake.

Clouds rolled in providing nice shade as I crossed the plains and ascended to the NW with
nice alpine flowers on the foothills.  Hiked almost non-stop to to the Toutle River cg on the
E. face, reaching it just before dinner.  Found a decent small cg for my tent along a bluff
overlooking the river & got some sprinkles as I ate.  The sprinkling stopped a few hours 
later.

Next morning was cooler and misty with little visibility.  Packed and hiked up the steep
ascent before stopping for bfast & coffee.  Rain kept things cool on the way up and was 
even a little chilly while eating.  After a while the clouds broke up and some sun appeared.

Hiked the S. face with nice sunny views of the snowy peak.  Nice shaded forest trail & back
to the car by noon.  Made the long drive home.

### Fun facts

- Much easier hike without all the backtracking I did the last time
- Arroyos seemed easier - perhaps more moisture to keep the trail from crumbling
- Trail was much busier than last time - hardly saw anyone last time.
