A full day at Echo Cliffs.

Despite an early start, the popular routes were all taken, so we returned to
the last weekend's routes.  Multipitched a few times for good rappel
experience.  Got lead and top rope practice.  Really felt dehydrated all day
and the wall got too hot to climb by 2pm.  Next time need even more water.
