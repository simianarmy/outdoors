Loop climbs Pine Creek trail,traverses Granite Park and Bear Lakes Basin, over Feather Pass to junction
with French Canyon Trail & upcanyon to Pine Creek Pass.

The mosquitos were out in full force but they couldn't ruin this epic 4 day
loop through absurdly gorgeous terrain.  Much of it x-country & free from
crowds.

Highlights: Granite Park, snow traverse from Italy pass to Dancing Bear pass,
ridiculous beauty of Bear Lakes Basin, descending from Feather Pass to French
Canyon trail through rugged terrain.

### Fun facts

Getting a hammock setup in treeless terrain took much longer than I thought.
Spent a good 3 hours scouting rocks, trying various attachments until I found
a perfect shelf.
