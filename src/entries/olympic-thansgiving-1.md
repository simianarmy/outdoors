Thanksgiving exploring the Olmpic peninsula.

On the first day arrived at the Hoh river trailhead around noon and headed out with only 5 hours of daylight left.  Hiked through the mossy Hoh rainforest.  Reached a campsite on the river and setup camp close to it on a rocky bank.  Temp dropped quickly after dark.  Really felt the cold at night and toes got pretty frozen in the sleeping bag.  By sunrise woke up to a layer of frost on everything.  Headed to LaPush for some sunset beach views and a hot dinner.  Decided to head back to Port Angeles to get a iphone charging cable replacement and some fire-making supplies.  Spent the night enjoying a warm motel bed.

Next day headed out to Cape Alava trailhead and made the 3 mile hike along
wooden walkway through underbrush to the coast.  There were a few campsites
taken up but easily found a good spot towards the northern end.  Collected
firewood and made a fire to keep warm into the evening.  In the morning hiked
south along the coast to the other campground at Sand Point and completed the
loop along wooden walkways to the trailhead.
