Wanted to practice some snow camping & conditions looked good for a weekend in the Angeles Natl Forest near Mt Baldy.

Much of the San Gabriels were inaccessible due to fire closures so choices were limited but looked like snow levels where
decent above 7000 ft around the popular Ice House Canyon trail leading to nearby peaks.
