Wanted to practice some snow camping & conditions looked good for a weekend in the Angeles Natl Forest near Mt Baldy.

Much of the San Gabriels were inaccessible due to fire closures so choices were limited but looked like snow levels where
decent above 7000 ft around the popular Ice House Canyon trail leading to nearby peaks.

Made the short hike up the popular canyon trail to arrive at the saddle by noon.  Put on the microspikes to hike to the campsite
which had just enough of a dry patch for my tent.  Pitched tent then continued up to Ontario Peak for great views of 
Baldy and the E. side of the ridge.

Back down the ridge then continued up a short way to Bighorn Peak shortly before sunset.  Night was chilly & windy but stayed pretty 
warm in the down quilt.  A little too much work keeping it wrapped tight around my torso for my liking so will use a regular 
bag for these temps.

Stayed in tent till later than usual b/c it didn't want to warm up until past 9.  Hiked back to saddle and made a quick 
trip up to Timber mntn peak before heading back and along the Chapman trail to reach the car by early afternoon.
