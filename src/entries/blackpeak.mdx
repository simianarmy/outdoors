Scramble up Black Peak with SAC friends

Vicc planned the outing, we just showed up!  We (Vicc, Cambry, Spencer, Andrew)
carpooled in my car (5) from Sedro.
Cars were parked for a mile in both directions at the th!  Never seen so many
at a trailhead before - people are crazy for larches!

Decided on later day approach to the camp since the route wasn't very far & we 
thought we might avoid some trail traffic from the larch-looky-looers.  Trail
was fairly busy but we plowed through them to reach the pass shortly.  Short
break before continuing across the long boulder field to Lewis lake & up to 
pretty Wing lake.  It was kind of a zoo up there with 40+ tents, but the cirque
had plenty of spots for tents (many of them on green, unfortunately.)

I found a nice hammock hang and we had an early dinner around 5.  It got brisk 
after the sun went down & we decided on early bedtime for an alpine-ish start
to avoid too much rockfall danger from other climbers.  Cloudless sky but moon
obscurred stars for 1st part of night.  I wasn't able to spot the 1/80K year comet
as too many peaks surrounding us blocking sky views.

All up at the designated time and I had quick espresso, delaying the group start
time but all good.  Filled up our waters at the lake and started the approach to
the scree field.  Wind picked up at various spots but managed to delayer to a
base layer once sun war up.  Helmets went on as we started the steeper ascent up
the scree.  We ended up reaching the bouldery sections quickly and all made the 
class 4 moves without issue, with Cambry leading the way.

Peak wasn't too crowded and we enjoyed about an hour up there taking in the views.

Downclimb was somewhat scarier but we helped each other pointing out the footholds.
Struggled descending the loose rock scree field and had a hard time not disloging
rocks at each other.  We all spread out a ways and met up at the base.

Relaxed back at camp for some lunch snacks then enjoyed the return trip with
another sunny day & many pictures of the larchies.
