Checked out Joshua Tree for a couple nights, visiting the NW corner with higher
elevations and the main entrance in the North with a number of cool climbing
spots.

Not much too it...a lot of Joshua Trees and desert.  Hiking was boring since
the scenery changes very little.

Through hike with stashed water might be fun
