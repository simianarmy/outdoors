Grand Teton camp & climb

Arrived in Salt Lake city late Thursday for the labor day holiday weekend.
Andre chose the destination as a climb he had wanted to do for a long time.
Drove rental car from SLC to campground outside of town.  Next morning had
breakfast at rustic Utah diner filled with old farmers then drove through Idaho
and into Wyoming along scenic Snake River, arriving in Jackson at lunchtime.
Got a good meal in the town square with all the other posh tourists then headed
into the Grand Teton National Park to inquire about permits for the Grand Teton
climb.  Despite busy weekend we got a permit for campsite near base of the
climb (the Morraine) for the following night.  Got good beta on the
climbing route and approach from the rangers.
Had time to kill so found a campground outside the park (huge - had 300+
spots!) then drove north to Yellowstone Park.  Only about 1.5 hours drive
north, entered Yellowstone and went to the Old Faithful geyser.  Nothing too
impressive but waited about 1 hour for the geyser to do its thing then headed
back to camp.  Arrived after dark and setup camp.
Sat morning knew we had plenty of time for the approach hike so took our time
getting ready.  Drove into Jackson for breakfast & coffee & last minute gear at
the mountain shop.  Drove into the parking lot at trailhead and surpised to
find it almost completely full.  Spotted a lot of climbers getting ready so
figured we would have plenty of company on the climb - a good thing when you
don't know the route.  With very heavy packs, we started the hike to the
campsite from ~ 6300 ft.  Nice sunny day and lots of picturesque scenery to
look at on the hike up. Made it to camp in just under 6 hours at ~ 11,000 ft.

From our camp at the Morraine we could see a bit of the Grand Teton above.
Fortunately this time of year the route was snow and ice-free, making it
considerably easier.  Unfortunately the combination of wind and my tent's
shitty rainfly construction made for unending noise that prevented me from
getting *any* sleep that night.  By the time I was seeing headlamps pass our
tent, I knew it was time to give up on sleep and get ready for the day's climb.

We got ready at about 4:30 am but didn't leave camp until 5:30 due to logistics
of preparing in darkness.  With headlamps on helmets we joined the procession
of lights tracing the path up the Morraine to the Lower Saddle.  After some
rock scrambling we reached a headwall fitted with knotted ropes to aid the
climb.  From the headwall we reached the Lower Saddle with NW & SE views.
There were a few semi-permanent camps setup there for the guide services.  By
dawn we were approaching the first part of the Grand Teton that requred some
class 4 scrambling.  The large groups were thinning as each went on different
routes to the summit.  Our chosen route was the Owen-Spalding route,
technically the easiest (when not icey) route at 5.4 which ascends from the
West face of the Grand Teton (or towards the West, whatever).  Followed an
older couple who looked like they knew the route.  Made a traverse across
exposed but easy slab for the 1st technical move.  Once above the slab ascended
gullies filled with loose rock to the Upper Saddle where the roped climbing
begins.

There was a line to the climbing route and it was very windy at our elevation
so everyone hunkered down in their parkas and waited for their turn, trying to
keep warm.  I switched to my climbing shoes but kept the hiking socks on!  Once
it was our turn, we roped up and I belayed Andre as he quickly disappeared
around the face on the 1st pitch traverse.  I followed and saw the first move
was called a "belly roll" as you start crawling between overhanging rock then
rolling your feet over & down and making your way across the exposed face (with good handholds).  Didn't feel as scary as the route description anyways.  Next pitch was another traverse named the "belly crawl" I think b/c you just saueeze yourself between rock without much room on either side.  Short & easy.  Followed by a more difficult move into a chimney which I struggled with for some time.  After that chimney it was more or less easy climbing - some were doing it without rope (!) and some were roped together (simul-climb?)  We just took it easy and made our way up a few snort pitches at a time until we got to a section where scrambling made more sense - which we did until reaching the peak.  The peak itself was not big and we had to share it with 4 - 5 other groups.  The views were OK nothing spectacular but it was nice to feel the sun's warmth and be able to rest for a few.
We downclimbed to a rappel anchor, rap'd that then Andre scouted around for the
tne next rap station, which took some time.  Once found we got ready for the
big rappel with ended with 60 ft of free hanging, meaning there was nothing for
feet to put weight on, you are hanging and lowering yourself, which is quite
a weird feeling at first.  Andre got a good gopro video of me doing it.  This
rappel left us at the beginning of the climb where I had left my hiking boots.
Swapped out climbing shoes for boots and we made our way down the gullies.  By
then the urge to poo had become considerable and I was activley looking for
spots to relieve myself - unfortunately there were a few groups with us and the
route was not exactly conducive to exploring.  We found a rappel station above
the tricky slab and were able to make 2 raps down to the beginning of the
scramble.  From there I quickly found a spot and used the cool wag bag given to
me by the ranger.  Feeling much better, but day was getting late & we didn't
make it back to camp until after 6 so decided to stay at our camp and leave
early Monday morning.  We didn't have a permit for 2 nights but figured we
could just say were too exhausted to leave that day :)  Unfortunately my water
filter had stopped working and we were relying on my water purifier tablets
which I had lost somehow during the climb.  Without a means to safe drinking
water, we almost considered breaking camp and hiking out that night, but I was
too tired to attempt it and thought we could boil enough drinking water to make
it.  Spent an hour boiling water then decided to try the water filter one last
time.  Lo & behold it started working like a charm ??!  So we dumped the
questionable boiled water and filled up on nice cold water.  This time I didn't
care about the wind b/c there was no way I was *not* going to get sleep after
2 days of arduous physical activity.  I managed to get some good
zs in and we got to breaking camp around 6:30.

Broke camp and descended the 6K+ feet to reach the car before noon.  Found
a shower facility in Jackson and got cleaned up which felt pretty great.  Back
to town for a nice lunch + beer then to the car for the long drive back to SLC.

Got to airport in time to relax in the Delta sky lounge thanks to Andre's
access.  LAX was the usual zoo at 10pm and it took over an hour to get a taxi
and get out of the airport.
