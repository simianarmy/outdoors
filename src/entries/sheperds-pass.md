A new path into the Whitney high country via Sheperds Pass.  From the pass down to
cross the JMT/PCT at Tyndall Creek then West to revisit the upper Kern river
lakes, then a cross-country climb to Lake South America & back down to Tyndal Creek.
Backtrack over the pass to the TH.

Spent the 1st night below Sheperds Pass due to the lengthy and strenous hike
from the TH, much of it in shadeless heat.  Also not in great shape for
climbing.  Next day crested the pass with a small snowfield crossing and down
3.5 miles to the JMT/PCT at Tyndall Creek.  Continued West on the Upper Kern
cutoff trail to a scenic unnamed lake with just enough time to put up tarp
before heavy rains and thunder.  Was able to relax in the hammock during the
storm.  Next morning had sunny skies so explored the area around the lake
looking for more hammock trees and the trail to Lake South America.  Trail not
to be found so used combo of GPS and map to climb up some miles to 1st visible
trail.  Continued past scenic lakes up steep terrain to finally reach 12K feet
and the lake.  Relaxed at lake then continued loop down to the Kern cutoff
trail.  Rejoined trail and setup camp at Tyndal Creek before a few sprinkles.
Had run out of trail so decided to hike back next day since it would be a long
one.  Next morning probably starting to feel the onset of my pneumonia but
still managed to reach Sheperds pass before noon.  From there the hike was
quite strenous and required many breaks.  There was a long climb to be done
w/out shade that took quite a lot of time & energy.  After that the last 4-5
miles downhill to the TH seemed to take forever.  Made it to car by 7pm
& started the day's hike at 9!

### Fun facts

A coyote ran past me on my way down from Lake S America.  They were making
a lot of noise in the area.
