First foray into the North Cascades wilderness.  Can't wait to return.

Truly epic scenery.  Great solitude, challenging climbs and rewarding views
make this loop worth the early morning wake up for permits.

Unfortunately missed a lot of the best views from Copper ridge due to clouds,
but don't need a reason to go back!

Spent first night at Copper lake below the ranger fire lookout station.  Ranger
took me and another hiker into the lookout for a tour and some hot tea.  She was cute, handgun and all.
Wish I had left my digits!

### Fun facts

First close encounter with a black bear - this one was big!  Felt & heard it
running down the hillside before I turned the bend to see a dark mass disappear
into the brush.

Took hand-powered cable-car across the river!  Sat in the metal bucket and
turned a crank which slowly moved me under a cable high above the river.  So
awesome!

Blueberry bushes as far as the eye could see

Quite a few painful blisters on this trip
