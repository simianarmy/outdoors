Long hike along Siuattle river and climb to picturesque Image Lake.

A nice overnight hike along the Siuattle river near Darrington then a tough
climb up Miners Ridge Trail to Image Lake with views of Glacier Peak.

Had a nice swim in the lake, but the campsites were overrun and ended up
a couple feet away from another tent who spent quite some time praying then
snoring.

Checked out the Miners Ridge Lookout on the way back.

Gave a through-hiker from Texas a ride back to Seattle.  His trip from Stevens
Pass to the northern end of the PCT was screwed by the fires in the area.
Learned a lot about ultralight hiking from him - first time I heard about it in
practice.  He gave me his detailed NatGeo maps & I hope I get the chance to use
them someday.
