Continuing my equipment testing for snow camping, headed back to Idyllwild but not for climbing this time.

From the highway just outside town, hit the Deer creek trailhead for a steady climb to snow level above 8000 ft.  Microspikes got me to the Little Round Valley campsite by 2 where I had time to explore the usually popular sites to find the ideal spot.

After setting up close to the trail, passing campers informed me that all the sites were actually a few hundred yards from the trail.   After following their lead I found out why - great views to the West across the Moreno Valley.  Flattened snow for the tent and relaxed in the sun until it got chilly.  For the sunset, found a good viewing rock and took in the view until long past dark.

Night was comfortable in the bag - no moisture through the floor but will need a ground cover for wetter snow.  Up early and after using the Eagle scout-built privy, headed up to the peak of San Jacinto along some obvious tracks.  Great 360 views as usual up there.  Got back to break camp then ambled down the 9 miles back to the car.  Enjoyed a milkshake in town before the drive home.
