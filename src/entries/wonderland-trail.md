A classic hike for the ages.  7 nights circumnavigating Mt Rainier through
incomparable natural beauty.  Even with a crowded trail and packed campsites,
this easily ranks in my top 5 and I'm confident it will remain so forever.

Rather than trying to describe it in great detail, I'll simply note the
campsites used each night for future reference.  The permit system basically
dictates what sites you stay at each night, which in turn dictates
your daily mileage.  I had little choice in the matter since I came at one the
busiest months of one of the busiest (so far) years in the park.  In fact
I barely secured a reservation and had to waste 2 days in the area until my
time came.

1. **Mowich Lake to South Mowich River**  
   One of 4 primary trailheads - crowded

2. **North Puyallup River**  
   Close to river - nothing special

3. **Devil's Dream**  
   Arrived after dark - no views

4. **Nickel Creek**   
   Food cache pickup at Longmire  
   Cosy - no views other than creek

5. **Indian Bar**    
   One of the best - stayed in the group camp brick cabin

6. **White River Campground**    
   Food cache pickup  
   Crowded and full of car campers - lame

7. **Mystic Lake**  
   Beautfiful
