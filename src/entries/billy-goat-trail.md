First time in the Meathow valley & Pasayten wilderness.  Drive from Seattle is
long but arrived over pass at sunrise for epic views.  Stopped at ranger
station for map & info.  After a few wrong turns, finally found road to
trailhead at Burch Mountain.

Hike climbs up steadily to Billy Goat Pass under Billy Goat Mountain.  Back
down and up to Three Fools Pass.  Continued along Larch creek up to Larch
pass.  At highest point on the pass, thunder brought rain & hail.  Made it down
to Corral Lake just in time to set up tent before hailstorm.

Woke up to snow-covered tent - almost a foot of snow!  Low visiblity kept me
from continuing north to Peeve Pass and beyond so after enjoying views of
larches at the pass, backtracked to Diamond creek area and followed trail to
the northeast with climb to a lake on the map.  Unable to find trail to the
lake, so setup camp in meadow with good views.

Snow-free morning with sun and a friendly/hungry deer who had been sniffing
around all night.  Backtracked to trailhead and made the long drive home.
