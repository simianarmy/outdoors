After Enchantments outing cancelled due to lousy weather - looked for a larch march
somewhere closer.  Despite recent snow, decided on a loop in the East Cascades.
Plan was to hike 10 miles and camp near one of the 3 Oval Lakes among the larches
then complete the loop.

Reached Eagle Creek TH after a bfast bagel at the Twisp bakery.  Grabbed a bagel
sammy for lunch to go and reached the TH by 10:30?.  Only a few cars around - I 
figured hunters or day hikers.  Sunny day but expected snow later and throughout
the night.

Reached snow on trail after a few miles of slow elevation gain.  Put on the gaiters
and dealt with wet socks & shoes.  Hiked through burn scar along Oval creek and 
continued slow climb to 5000 ft.  Passed returning trail runner otherwise no one
else around.  Steeper section to 6000 ft with first sight of yellow/burnt orange larches.
Most needles had dropped on show, leaving patches of orange underneath.  Light snow
started around 5pm.  Had to decide on camping at nearby W Oval lake (6400 ft)or continuing
higher to 7600 ft then descending to the other Middle and E Oval lakes.  Trail 
by now was completely covered and there was a long exposed section on steep slopes
to a the high point.  I should have just setup camp early at W Oval after seeing the
steep crossing I would have to do and return on, but since I had a couple hours to kill
before dark I kept going.  1/2 across the steep slope I realized if there was any
avy danger it would be here, but the snow was not that deep (up to knees in spots)
and I figured it was still too early in the season for serious avy conditions.

Still, the runout was long and often went over rocky bands, so would be pretty
terrible.  Made it across as wind and snow really picked up.  Descending was ok - 
there was some visible path I could follow and the downhill to the lakes had some
deep snow but manageable.  Sluffed down the last 800 ft to the first lake (Middle Oval)
and found a good flat CG there (completely covered in snow but with some wind coverage
from trees.  Spent too long setting up hammock & tarp in heavy snow.  Finally got 
it setup though not happy with how low hammock hung over ground, but couldn't get it 
any higher.  Ate dinner under the tarp in darkness with cold feet in wet socks &
trail runners.  Hung the ursack a good distancd from camp.

Happy to get into warm sleep socks and under the new down quilt.  Tarp was holding
up fine though snow was barreling down like hail.  Used the down booties over the 
socks since it was going to be a cold night.  

Got some sleep but a couple times had to get up and try to adjust the hammock when it
got too close to the ground.  Hard to adjust the icy webbing.  Had to smack the tarp
walls to keep the snow from weighing them down too much.  Wind and snow all night
kept the temps low and I even felt the cold in feet with the down booties!  Also
had to put on the thermals.

Morning I waited to see if the snow would let up.  I had a small window when it lightened
and took the opportunity to get up and cook up breakfast under the tarp.
Noticed at least a foot of new snow had fallen overnight.  Not very excited about
the snow traverse and considered an alternate route that would bypass it, but unsure
about the xc route on the map so decided to go for it.

Heavy snow had resumed by the time I was at the high point and path I had taken
day before was completely covered.  Made it across the dangerous sections above
the rocky cliff bands and had maybe 100 ft left before reaching the fork in the trees.
Crossing a natural gully I noticed snow depth increased considerably and I was almost
up to my waist in it.  Then the snow started sliding under me and I tried jumping
ahead but no good - was in the avalanche for a good 30-40ft, on my back.  I 
always stayed above the snow and it slowed then stopped gradually as the slide
reached lower angle snow, but still shaken, and sore from the hard chunks hitting
my lower back.  Had lost my trecking poles and trusty nalgene but didn't see any
point in risking going back to look for them, and the snow/wind was still blowing
hard, so went ahead back towards the main trail.

Still had to be careful for terrain traps as the snow was pretty deep and there
were plenty chances for small slides over steep rocky terrain.  Felt better once
I reached the switchbacks on the trail below the lake, though everything completely
covered.

Noticed plenty of deer tracks on the trail - probably didn't have to worry about 
hunters that weekend. Made my way down with a break for lunch with hot miso and
a couple shots of whiskey for warmth.

A few miles from TH, past a father/son pitching their tent right on trail and 
cutting wood to make a fire...ok.
Got some sun breaks on the last few miles and enjoyed the view of fresh snow
and bright yellow/green foliage.

Happy to change into dry clothes at the car.  Stopped in Winthrop for dinner
and dealt with snowy roads across Washington pass.  Fortunately almost no traffic
so was able to go at my own speed.

### Fun Facts

- Big branch fell on tarp in the middle of the night - scared me!

- Nothing really fun about avalanches
