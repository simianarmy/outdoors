    <p>A dude walking and sometimes climbing</p>

    <blockquote>Climb the mountains and get their good tidings. Natureâ€™s peace will
      flow into you as sunshine flows in to trees. The winds will blow their own freshness into you,
      and the storms their energy, while cares will drop off like autumn leaves. - John Muir
